SQL Baseics - Handling multiple tables 
-- Question. What are the three longest trips on rainy days?
--We'll start by setting a rainy table and joining dates of trip duration & rainy days
Code:
with rainy
AS( 
	select  
	DATE(date) event_date,
   from weather
	where events = 'Rain'
   group by 1
  )
select 
	t.trip_id,
	t.duration, 
	DATE(t.start_date)
from trips t
join rainy r
on DATE(t.start_date) = r.event_date
order by duration DESC
limit 3;

Out: 
"1173890"	"85900"	"2016-04-22"
"1009870"	"84349"	"2015-11-15"
"1210487"	"83915"	"2016-05-21"

Q2. Which station is full most often?

Code: --creating a full talbe from status talbe
select status.station_id, stations.name,
count(case when status.docks_available =0 then 1 end) fill_count
from status
join stations
on stations.station_id = status.station_id
group by 1, 2
order by fill_count desc;

Output
4	"Santa Clara at Almaden"	"5788"
3	"San Jose Civic Center"		"1444"
2	"San Jose Diridon Caltrain Station"	"626"
5	"Adobe on Almaden"		"0"

Q3. Return a list of stations with a count of number of trips starting at that station but ordered by dock count?

Code:--creating a full talbe from status talbe
select stations.name, 
	trips.start_station,
	count(stations.dockcount) docks_count
from stations
join trips
on trips.start_station = stations.name
group by 1, 2
order by docks_count desc;

Output:
